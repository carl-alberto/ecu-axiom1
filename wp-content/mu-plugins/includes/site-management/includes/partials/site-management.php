            <p>I type git commit<br>
and I'm stuck inside of vim<br>
it's been six years now</p>

<p>learning JavaScript<br>
is like a really cool sword<br>
you hold by the blade</p>

<p>I have to git pull<br>
I'm not religious, but Lord<br>
please no merge conflicts</p>

<p>nineteen ninety nine<br>
my first site was a page of<br>
Dragonball Z gifs</p>

<p>school taught us Java<br>
and said we'd be Java devs<br>
boy, they were way off</p>

<p>imagine if we<br>
stopped gatekeeping junior devs<br>
too bad we're a-holes</p>

<p>put in a PR<br>
where I forgot to remove<br>
console log("please work");</p>

<p>looked up array slice<br>
eight times this week; here comes my<br>
imposter syndrome</p>

<p>TDD is great<br>
wait, the deadline is for when?<br>
we'll write tests later</p>

<p>my work day is just<br>
faking confidence for the<br>
product manager</p>

<p>let's take a moment<br>
to remember the short lives<br>
of our side projects</p>

<p>I wrote Hello World<br>
maybe three years ago so<br>
yes I know Python</p>

<p>no time to fix tests<br>
git force push no verify<br>
so long, pre-commit</p>

<p>QA just called in<br>
a full bomb disposal squad<br>
my code did not pass</p>

<p>I just spent two hours<br>
choosing a colour palette<br>
should have done law school</p>

<p>I pretend I know<br>
what this "Kubernetes" is<br>
it sounds like it's drugs</p>

<p>I do something called<br>
hype-driven development<br>
I like shiny things</p>

<p>I say I'm full stack<br>
but I just never got good<br>
at any one thing</p>
